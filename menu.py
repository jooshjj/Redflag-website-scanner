The script uses the requests library to send HTTP requests and retrieve website content. The ssl, socket, time, and re libraries are also used.\n\nThe script performs the following checks:\n\n- Retrieves the IP address of the website and its region using the GeoIP API.\n- Makes a GET request to the website and checks if its SSL/TLS certificate is valid.\n- Retrieves some details about the website, such as the content type and server.\n- Checks if the website is a phishing website by looking for certain keywords in its content.\n- Finds all subdomains of the website and checks if they are active.\n- Finds all email addresses and usernames mentioned on the website.\n\nThe get_website_region function takes an IP address as input and retrieves the region name using the GeoIP API. The check_website_security function takes a website URL as input and performs all the checks described above.\n\nThe find_subdomains function takes a domain name as input and returns a set of all its subdomains. The find_emails_usernames function takes a string of text as input and returns two lists: one containing all email addresses mentioned in the text and one containing all usernames mentioned in the text."
